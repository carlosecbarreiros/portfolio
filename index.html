                Hi there! My name is Carlos Eduardo. I am nineteen years old and enrolled in the
                fourth semester of Computer Science at Anhembi Morumbi University. I completed high school at Adventist
                College of Liberdade in 2022. I've always had a passion for computers and a natural aptitude for related
                subjects. <br> <br>
                I was uncertain
                about what I wanted to do for a long time. Soccer has always been a top priority for me since childhood.
                I have experience in soccer clubs in Sao Paulo and have even played professionally in Germany. I spent
                six
                months competing in the regional tournament for Fv Rot-Weiß Weiler in Germany. I lived bymyself at the
                team
                apartment and improved my English skills because most people around me communicated in English. <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, even though I had been playing soccer in 2022, I never dismissed the opportunity of
                following an IT career; I always saw it with good eyes. I never put my studies aside; I always dedicated
                and committed myself to the maximum possible regarding my studies and soccer professional life. It is
                not for nothing that even when I lived in Germany, I conciliated my studies by transferring my tuition
                to a Distance Learning course and keeping my skill courses in my free time. Nevertheless, in July 2024,
                when I returned to Brazil, I concluded that I was willing to make a decision about my future and
                dedicate
                myself 100% to one thing only. I decided to build my career in thiscomputing world, which I have been
                relating
                very well to. <br> <br>
                Nowadays, I am seeking my first professional experience in IT, where I intend to grow professionally,
                learn a lot, and apply my knowledge such as Programming (back-end/front-end), Programming Libraries and
                Frameworks (jQuery, VueJS, React, Angular, etc.), Relational Database (SQL), Non-Relational Database
                (NoSQL), UML, System Requirements, Computer Networks, and Information Security. Some of my skills
                include being
                focused and organized, having good interpersonal relationships, teamwork, and a strong aptitude for
                learning.
                Even though my English skills are already advanced - I have studied for five years at CNA and practiced
                my English
                during my stay in Germany, I have been studying with a private teacher to refine my English even
                further.

                    where user information is stored in an array of objects.
