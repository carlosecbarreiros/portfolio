            <p class="biography-text">
                Hi there! My name is Carlos Eduardo. I am nineteen years old and enrolled in the
                fourth semester of Computer Science at Anhembi Morumbi University. I completed high school at Adventist
                College of Liberdade in 2022. I've always had a passion for computers and a natural aptitude for related
                subjects. <br> <br>
                I was uncertain
                about what I wanted to do for a long time. Soccer has always been a top priority for me since childhood.
                I have experience in soccer clubs in Sao Paulo and have even played professionally in Germany. I spent
                six
                months competing in the regional tournament for Fv Rot-Weiß Weiler in Germany. I lived bymyself at the
                team
                apartment and improved my English skills because most people around me communicated in English. <br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, even though I had been playing soccer in 2022, I never dismissed the opportunity of
                following an IT career; I always saw it with good eyes. I never put my studies aside; I always dedicated
                and committed myself to the maximum possible regarding my studies and soccer professional life. It is
                not for nothing that even when I lived in Germany, I conciliated my studies by transferring my tuition
                to a Distance Learning course and keeping my skill courses in my free time. Nevertheless, in July 2024,
                when I returned to Brazil, I concluded that I was willing to make a decision about my future and
                dedicate
                myself 100% to one thing only. I decided to build my career in this computing world, which I have been
                relating
                very well to. <br> <br>
                Nowadays, I am seeking my first professional experience in IT, where I intend to grow professionally,
                learn a lot, and apply my knowledge such as Programming (back-end/front-end), Programming Libraries and
                Frameworks (jQuery, VueJS, React, Angular, etc.), Relational Database (SQL), Non-Relational Database
                (NoSQL), UML, System Requirements, Computer Networks, and Information Security. Some of my skills
                include being
                focused and organized, having good interpersonal relationships, teamwork, and a strong aptitude for
                learning.
                Even though my English skills are already advanced - I have studied for five years at CNA and practiced
                my English
                during my stay in Germany, I have been studying with a private teacher to refine my English even
                further.

                    the database, where user information is stored in an array of objects. The challenges were to test
                    the student's mastery of logic and object-oriented programming.

                    (Unified Modeling Language), for the diagrams and Requirements Engineering, for the implementations.
